<div class="entry-content"><p>This post is about one of my first and biggest role models, my dad. He worked a lot and wasn&rsquo;t around much while we were growing up, but he would bring home computers in the early 90s from work, drilling us on Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing and other educational software. His favorite answer to any question was &lsquo;look it up!&rsquo;, but he&rsquo;d always hang around to explain context or fill in background details when the Encarta encyclopedia entry didn&rsquo;t satisfy us.</p>

<p>Recently, he agreed to let me interview him. What follows is the story he constructed in response to those questions. His trajectory was not a traditional one, but I wanted to share it here to reinforce the value of curiosity and resourcefulness- and not always a formal education- in finding something you love and a way to earn a living from it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Around 1960 I had been out of the military for 2 years and had no idea what I wanted to do for a living.  I had been reading the Times classifieds for inspiration and I came across a three line ad recruiting programmers for the forthcoming 1401 computer. This was before there really was a popular definition of what a programmer was (or what a computer was).</p>

<p>IBM had introduced the 650 and 7070 computers previously but had marketed them in the scientific and/or engineering communities, so they weren&rsquo;t really in the popular lexicon. The closest thing in the commercial world was a model 407 accounting machine that IBM marketed which was &lsquo;programmed&rsquo; with a breadboard (plugging little wires into a board allowing basic data manipulation and  arithmetic functions).  Anyway, I lied and charmed my way into the job only to find that the dept manager was from my hometown and knew how unqualified (education) I really was.  Enthusiasm and scoring on a programming aptitude test was the real criteria.</p>

<p>My three co-workers were formerly a librarian, a mathematician and a Los Vegas blackjack dealer.  IBM was scheduled to deliver one of the first production 1401&rsquo;s in six months time, so in the interim we developed the system and wrote code in machine language and got trained up in SPS (symbolic programming language) and Autocoder by IBM. Fifteen minute test shots in the middle of the night at the Time-Life building.  So exciting. And the people, from start to finish, were my kind of people.  A little off-the-wall, pretty much original thinkers. Not duplicitous, competitive in a good hearted way.</p>

<p>Well, the 1401 was so wildly successful that more sophisticated languages like Cobol, Fortran and RPG and machines like the 360/370  were quickly introduced.  The 360 was the popular successor to the 1400 series and Cobol was, for me, the link forword.  It was mainframe commercial application programming, then systems and programming  Programmers were in constant demand so it was a buyers market and I job hopped for quite a long time, eventually switching to contracting (freedom from the 9 to 5 schedule), then finally settling with Con Ed for the med/surg benefits for Sarah (and retirement benefits).  I had a shot at managing a group which I accepted grudgingly and was relieved to give up. There were occasional forays into the more esoteric like channel command programming for an optical scanner, the system I developed (Scheduling, billing and AR/AP in Foxpro) for Athome (on my own time) and a sub-station transformer data collection and analysis system using frame-relay technology for anticipating problems.</p>

<p>When PC&rsquo;s came over the horizon, I left mainframe systems for a great job (within Con Ed) supporting a hybrid PC/mainframe network which came with an opportunity to acquire Microsoft OS, Unix and Cisco networking skills. Most of the education required was self-taught, some was one-on-one with a vendor rep or in an in-house course with a small group.</p>

<p>In summary, I think that the most important qualifications (given intelligence) are affinity/interest and enthusiasm for the field in general, and a good(great) disposition.   Come to think of it, any boss only wants the job done and to not have a bunch of problems land on her/his desk.  If you&rsquo;re an interesting fun person, you&rsquo;re over the top.  However,  you still need to get the interview.</p>

<p>Th-th-thats-all-folks.</p>
